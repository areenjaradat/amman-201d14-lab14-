areenjaradat & duha yousef & mohammad al-khazali we are help each other in code
we strt from catalogjs to having the correct values. 
so start from function populateForm() we need to fill the options in the form and its done by  mohammad al-khazali.
then in handleSubmit(event) function  me and duha yousef discuss about it we need event for get the values from the form and mohammad al-khazali sugggest to declare them outside the function to use them in addSelectedItemToCart() function.
in addSelectedItemToCart() function we just call the cart.addItem(item,quantity); with parameters item,quantity from the form event.
the updateCounter() is done by mohammad al-khazali 
the function updateCartPreview() here we need to create a list in the div container and it's done by me.
the function showCart() need to create tr and td inside the tbody element 
we realy tried with functions clearCart() & removeItemFromCart(event) 
i tried with clearCart() by tbody.remove() , tbody.innerhtml='' and put it in array and delete the rows put all of them want effects
